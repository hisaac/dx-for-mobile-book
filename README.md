# DX For Mobile Teams (And Beyond)

This is the repository for my book about DX engineering for mobile development teams. Much of the content here will apply more generally (hence the 'And Beyond'), but the bulk of my experience has been working with mobile development teams, so that will be my focus here.

## Contributing

I've decided to try writing this book in the open. Like most software development areas, this moves very fast and is changing constantly. Hopefully be open sourcing the book's content, I can gather tips and contributions more easily from others.

If you'd like to contribute, please do! I'd welcome any advice, corrections, ideas, or anecdotes from your own experiences. Please create an Issue or Pull Request and we'll work from there. Or if you'd prefer, you can also [email me](mailto:dxbook@hisaac.net).
