# Introduction

## `whoami`

My name is Isaac Halvorson. I've been working in the developer experience space for most of my software development career, first as a product developer[^1] just wanting my tools to be more useful, then as "the CI guy" on the team, and now as a Developer Experience Engineer as my full-time official role.
